###### 	R project for:
###### SPATIO-TEMPORAL RAINFALL PATTERNS IN KAPUAS BASIN ######
	### SPATIAL INTERPOLATION OF PRECIPITATION DATA ON KAPUAS AND SUBCATCHMENTS ###

### R FILES ###
+ interpolation.R	## loads and interpolates the data; plots the results
# called from within interpolation.R:
+ graphic_pars.R 	## sets graphic paramters and creates color scheme
###
### NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS BEFORE RUNNING THE CODE ###
The analysis will use all stations it finds data and the georgaphical position for. If stations should be excluded, this has to be adjusted.
###
### NECESSARY FOLDER STRUCTURE ###
 /input		# contains input data
 		+ subfolders where data is located
 /output		# where output is written to
 /scripts		# all R scripts
	other folders are created automatically
###
